## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on [CodeDex.io](https://www.codedex.io/@Corrupt/30-nites-of-code) to sharpen my coding skills while juggling school projects. I'm diving into Python and eager to collaborate on any project that offers a chance to learn and grow.

Feel free to ask me anything or share your ideasâ€”I'm always up for a challenge and a good conversation!
